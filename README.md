# Vignettes

Vignettes consisting of sample workflows, gluing different tools together for various purposes. Each workflow lives in its own directory.  

- `/pathway_analysis` - pathway analysis - enrichment and visualization.
  - `individual-kegg-maps.ipynb` - how to GET individual KEGG pathway maps by KEGG pathway ID, with custom colours in user-selected nodes.
  - `maca-pathview-workbook.ipynb` - Example workflow with `MetaboAnalyst` and `pathview`.
- `/vsn` - exploring the use of variance-stabilizing normalization for normalization.
