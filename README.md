# Vignettes

Vignettes consisting of sample workflows, gluing different tools together for various purposes. Each workflow lives in its own directory.  

1. `/pathway_analysis` - pathway analysis - enrichment and visualization.
 * `individual-kegg-maps.ipynb` - how to GET individual KEGG pathway maps by KEGG pathway ID, with custom colours in user-selected nodes.
 * `maca-pathview-workbook.ipynb` - Example workflow with `MetaboAnalyst` and `pathview`.
2. `/vsn` - exploring the use of variance-stabilizing normalization for normalization.
