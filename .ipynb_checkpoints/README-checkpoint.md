# Vignettes

Vignettes consisting of sample workflows, gluing different tools together for various purposes. Each workflow lives in its own directory.  

1. `/pathway_analysis` - pathway analysis - enrichment and visualization. 
2. `/vsn` - exploring the use of variance-stabilizing normalization for normalization.
